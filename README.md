# A descriptive view on Spotify playlists
Project Report for Data Literacy 2021/22 Uni TÃ¼bingen

## Abstract
The aim of this paper is to get an intuition of how Spotify playlists are created and used. We take a look at different key data of playlists e.g. tracks, artists and followers. To cover a wide range of topics we chose a descriptive statistics view. Starting with some general stats, we calculated averages of interesting metrics and show how unique values behave when considering more data. Then we analyzed playlists with either more mainstream or uncommon tracks. There we found differences in the number of unique artists, but also in the amount of users that give a description of their playlist.
