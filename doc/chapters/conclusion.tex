\section{Conclusion}

After analyzing \var{SizeDataset} playlists we are able to get a feeling how the average popular/mainstream playlist would look like. First there is the size. The average playlist would have around \var{approx_average_numtracks} tracks with an average duration of about 4 min. Among the tracks there would at least be three of the top 50 common tracks. In the year 2017 would this mean, for example, that our playlist would include "HUMBLE", "Closer", "Congratulations" and "XO TOUR Llife3". Because our playlist is a mainstream playlist it has around ... unique artists. Which is more than an average uncommon playlist. The last detail that would make our playlist popular/mainstream would be a description to the playlist. Of course, all these measures are no guarantee for the popularity of a playlist, but our paper suggests that the majority of popular/mainstream playlists meet exactly these measures.
