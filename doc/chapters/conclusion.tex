\section{Conclusion}

After analyzing \var{SizeDataset} playlists we are able to get a feeling how the average  playlist would look like. It would have around \var{approx_average_numtracks} tracks and lasts about \var{converted_average_duration} in total. If the playlist contains at least 3  of the top 50 common tracks (e.g. in year 2017: "HUMBLE", "Closer" and "Congratulations") we can assume that it has around 34 unique artists. Vice versa when counting around 14 unique artists we can assume that this playlists contains less than three common tracks. When we see the playlist has been given a description it is likely that it has more followers than a playlist without a description. Of course, all these measures are no guarantee for the attributes of a playlist, but our paper suggests that the majority of playlists approximately follow these rules.
