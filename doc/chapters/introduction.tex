\section{Introduction}
Music is an essential part of the human culture. Wherever historians found evidence of human settlement, they also found evidence of musical activities. The oldest discovery of an instrument is a bone flute which is determined to be between 43,000 and 82,000 years old.\citep[p. 63]{Peretz2003} 

One of the biggest companies in today's music industry is Spotify - a streaming service used by hundreds of millions of people.\footnote{In the last shareholder letter of Q4 2021 Spotify announced an active user base of 406 million users.\citep{SpotifyTechnology2022}} Since Spotify has the highest market share ($ \approx 31\% $) in the music industry \citep{Mulligan2022}, we think that our analysis gives an insight of the listening habits of more people than the dataset is representing.
