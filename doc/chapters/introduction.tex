Music is an essential part of the human culture. Where ever historians founded evidence of human settlement, they also found evidence of musical activities. The oldest found of an instrument is a bone flute which is determined to be between 43,000 and 82,000 years old.\citep[p. 63]{Peretz2003} 

One of the biggest companies in today's music industry is Spotify - a streaming service used by hundreds of millions of people.\footnote{In the last shareholder letter of Q4 2021 Spotify announced an active user base of 406 million users.\citep{SpotifyTechnology2022}} Since Spotify is with around $31 \%$ the music streaming service with the highest market share \citep{Mulligan2022} we think that our analysis gives an insight of the listening habits of more people than the dataset is representing.
