\section{General Statistics}
To get a broad overview of the dataset we decided to make some general numerical analysis of the dataset to get a feeling for Spotify playlists as data and the scope of the dataset. In the dataset there are \var{SizeDataset} playlists\footnote{Originally there are 1 million playlists. Due to limited processing power we had to reduce our analysis to a dataset of \var{SizeDataset} playlists.} with a total number of \var{unique_tracks} unique tracks by \var{artists_unique} artists in \var{albums_unique} albums. The total length of all playlist is \var{converted_total_duration}.

The average number of tracks in one playlist are $\approx$ \var{approx_average_numtracks}\footnote{The exact number are \var{average_numtracks} tracks} tracks. Figure \ref{fig:averagetrack} shows how the average number of tracks per playlists changes, when more and more playlists are considered.

The average duration of a playlist is \var{converted_average_duration}. This fits (approximately) with the fact, that a track has an average duration of \var{converted_average_track_duration}.\footnote{Using the following calculation:\\$\text{average duration of track [ms]}\cdot\text{average number of tracks in a playlist}=\var{average_track_duration} \text{ ms}\cdot\var{average_numtracks}= \var{cal_average_playlist_duration} \text{ ms} = $ \var{converted_cal_average_playlist_duration}}

To get the most popular tracks, albums and artists, we counted how often they were occurring in a playlist. The result ca be seen in figure \ref{fig:popular}. The top 15 tracks are expectedly matching with the first 15 billboard charts of 2017 \cite{BillboardMedia}.
