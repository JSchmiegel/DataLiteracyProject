\section{General Statistics}
To get an overview of the dataset we decided to make some general numerical analysis on the dataset to get a feeling for the playlists as dataset. In the dataset there are $number of playslist$ playlists with a total number of $number of tracks$ tracks by $number of artists$ artists in $number of albums$ albums. The total length of all playlist is $total duration$.

The average number of tracks in one playlist are $average length tracks$. The total duration of all playlists is $total duration$, what makes an average duration of $average duration$. This matches with estimation, that a song has an average duration of $average track duration$.


From the total $number of tracks$ only $number of unique tracks$ are unique.
