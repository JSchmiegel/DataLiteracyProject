\section{The dataset}

As dataset for our project we are using the \textit{"The Million Playlist Dataset"} \citep{recsysChallenge} from Spotify\footnote{The dataset can be downloaded from \url{https://research.atspotify.com/datasets/}}. It consists of one million playlists (divided into 1,000 JSON files, where each file consist of 1,000 playlists) and is about 34 GB in size. The dataset was sampled from over four billion public playlists on Spotify. It includes only playlists which were created between January 2010 and November 2017 by US Spotify users, that are at least 13 years old. Originally the dataset was introduced as part of the \textit{RexSys Challenge 2018}. The Goal of the \textit{RexSys Challenge 2018} was to create an algorithm suggest appropriate songs to add to a playlist.\footnote{Further information: \url{https://www.recsyschallenge.com/2018/}}

% # Ingnore because it's not necessary
% An example of a playlist in the dataset\footnote{ten tracks are omitted to keep this example small}:
% \inputminted{json}{assets/example.json}
% % \begin{minted}[breaklines, breakanywhere,linenos, numbersep=5pt, gobble=0, frame=single]{json}
% % \end{minted}
